# Develop

To start the front, you will need:

1. **[only if you have made changes to the smart contracts]** latest smart contracts' types (generated by typechain in contracts repo)
2. local ethereum testnet (hardhat)
3. local subgraph node (subgraph lets you query on-chain (blockchain) data)
4. deploy our smart contract's subgraph to the local subgraph node
5. MetaMask wallet with the correct network and ethereum provider URL
6. start the front!

Let's tackle this step by step

**[optional] 1. latest smart contracts' types (generated by typechain in contracts repo)**
- go to: https://github.com/RENTFT/contracts-template/tree/symfoni-context, clone this branch
- run `yarn` to install the deps
- now run `yarn compile`
  you will get this
  ```
  Creating Typechain artifacts in directory     /Users/shredder/git/renft/contracts/frontend/src/hardhat/typechain for target ethers-v5
    Successfully generated Typechain artifacts!
   âœ¨  Done in 6.61s.
  ```
- you now have the types for our smart contracts in that directory
- for now you need to manually copy the `hardhat` directory's contents into this repo, into folder: `src/hardhat`

**2. local ethereum testnet (hardhat)**
- go to: https://github.com/RENTFT/contracts-template, clone it
- now run `yarn` to install the deps
- now run `yarn hardhat node --hostname 0.0.0.0 --watch`
- nb: if enabled, this step will also generate the types mentioned in step 1

**3. local subgraph node (subgraph lets you query on-chain (blockchain) data)**
- go to: https://github.com/RENTFT/local-subgraph-node, clone it
- `cd` into `docker` and run `sudo docker-compose up`
- nb: you may need to run `sudo docker-compose rm` if you have previously ran this command

**4. deploy our smart contract's subgraph to the local subgraph node**
- go to: https://github.com/RENTFT/subgraph, clone it
- now run `yarn` to install the deps
- now run `yarn create-local nazariyv/ReNFT`
- now run `yarn deploy-local`

**5. MetaMask wallet with the correct network and ethereum provider URL**
- I recommend using a different "profile" in your browser, to get a clean MetaMask account
- your seed phrase is "test test test test test test test test test test test junk"
- you will need to create a new metamask network with the following config

network name: localhost 8545

rpc url: http://localhost:8545

chain id: 1337

symbol: ETH

Our reNFT app has named accounts, third account is the lender and so will show the NFTs in the lend tab.

**6. Start the front**
- `yarn` to install deps in this repo
- `yarn dev` to start the dev server
